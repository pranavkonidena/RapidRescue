# Real-Time Emergency Response Optimization with AI Triage

## Overview
This project was developed for a hackathon and aims to optimize emergency response using AI triage. The project includes a mobile app, backend server, and a custom-trained spaCy model for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The app allows users to call for help, extract key details from their voice calls using speech-to-text models, and provide certified first aid tips based on the extracted information. Additionally, users can book ambulances through the app's map interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Mobile App:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Design:** Figma

## Features
- Real-time emergency response optimization
- Speech-to-text for call transcription
- Custom-trained spaCy model for NER
- Extraction of symptoms and conditions from voice transcripts
- Certified first aid tips based on extracted information
- Ambulance booking via map interface

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend server using Django and MySQL.
3. Install dependencies for the mobile app using Flutter.
4. Run the app on a compatible device or emulator.

## Usage
